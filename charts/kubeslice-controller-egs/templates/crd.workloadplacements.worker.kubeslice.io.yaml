                              observedGeneration represents the .metadata.generation that the condition was set based upon.
                              For instance, if .metadata.generation is currently 12, but the .status.conditions[x].observedGeneration is 9, the condition is out of date
                              with respect to the current state of the instance.

                              Many .condition.type values are consistent across resources like Available, but because arbitrary conditions can be
                              useful (see .node.status.conditions), the ability to deconflict is important.

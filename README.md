# üåê EGS Installer Script

This README provides a comprehensive guide to using the EGS Installer Script, which automates the deployment of EGS components such as Kubeslice controller, UI, and and array of worker within a Kubernetes environment.

## üöÄ Overview

The EGS Installer Script is a Bash script designed to streamline the installation, upgrade, and configuration of EGS components in Kubernetes clusters. It leverages Helm for package management, kubectl for interacting with Kubernetes clusters, and yq for parsing YAML files. The script allows for automated validation of cluster access, installation of required binaries, and the creation of Kubernetes namespaces and resources.

## ‚úÖ Prerequisites

Before using the EGS Installer Script, ensure that the following prerequisites are met:

- **Binaries**: The following binaries must be installed and available in your system's `PATH`:
  - `yq` üìÑ
  - `helm` üõ†Ô∏è
  - `kubectl` ‚öôÔ∏è
- **Kubernetes**: Ensure that you have access to the necessary Kubernetes clusters with the appropriate kubeconfig files.

## üõ†Ô∏è Configuration

The script requires a YAML configuration file to define various parameters and settings for the installation process. Below is an example configuration file (`egs-installer-config.yaml`) with descriptions for each section.

### üìù YAML Configuration File

```yaml
Here's the YAML configuration file with added comments for each section and key:

```yaml
# The base path to the root directory of your cloned repository.
# This will be used as a reference for all relative paths in the script, if empty it will use relative path to script.
base_path: ""

# Whether to run a pre-check before starting the installation process.
# This check validates the environment and required binaries.
precheck: true

# Whether to perform pre-checks specific to Kubeslice components.
# This includes verifying access to the clusters and checking node labels.
kubeslice_precheck: true

# This sets the maximum time the script will wait for all components to be verified as running.
verify_install_timeout: 600  # 10 minutes

# Global flag to decide whether to skip further steps if verification fails.
# If set to false, the script will exit on verification failure.

### Summary of Added Comments:
- **Explanation of each key**: Detailed comments explain the purpose and usage of each key and section within the YAML configuration file.
- **Default values**: For fields where defaults are commonly applied or where a value should be specified during runtime, notes have been added to indicate this.
- **Clarification of settings**: Each block of the YAML file is clarified with comments to make it easier to understand the intended configuration and to help avoid common pitfalls.

This should make the YAML configuration file much easier to understand and customize, especially for users who are new to the script or the specific technologies involved.
```

### üßë‚Äçüíª Script Usage

To run the script, use the following command:

```bash
./egs-installer.sh --input-yaml <yaml_file>
```

Replace `<yaml_file>` with the path to your YAML configuration file. For example:

```bash
./egs-installer.sh --input-yaml egs-installer-config.yaml
```

### üí° Command-Line Options

- `--input-yaml <yaml_file>`: Specifies the YAML configuration file to be used.
- `--help`: Displays usage information.

### üîë Key Features

1. **Prerequisite Checks**: Ensures that required binaries are installed. üõ†Ô∏è
2. **Kubeslice Pre-Checks**: Validates access to clusters and labels nodes if required. ‚úÖ
3. **Helm Chart Management**: Adds, updates, or removes Helm repositories and manages chart installations. üì¶
4. **Project and Cluster Management**: Automates the creation of projects and registration of clusters in the Kubeslice controller. üóÇÔ∏è
5. **Worker Configuration**: Fetches secrets from the controller cluster, prepares worker-specific values files, and manages worker installations. ‚öôÔ∏è

### üìú Example Workflow

1. **Run Pre-checks**: The script first validates that all prerequisites are met. ‚úÖ
2. **Kubeslice Pre-Checks**: Validates that the script can access all necessary clusters. üîç
3. **Install or Upgrade Helm Charts**:
   - Installs or upgrades the Kubeslice controller. üì¶
   - Installs or upgrades the Kubeslice UI. üíª
4. **Project and Cluster Management**:
   - Creates defined projects in the Kubeslice controller. üóÇÔ∏è
   - Registers defined clusters within these projects. üåç
5. **Worker Installation**: Installs or upgrades worker nodes, applying the necessary configuration. ‚öôÔ∏è

### üìù Notes

- Ensure the YAML configuration file is correctly formatted and contains all necessary fields. üìÑ
- The script will exit with an error if any critical steps fail unless configured to skip on failure. ‚ùå
- Paths specified in the YAML file should be relative to the `base_path` unless absolute paths are used. üìÅ

### üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

- **Missing Binaries**: Ensure all required binaries are installed and accessible in your system's `PATH`. ‚ö†Ô∏è
- **Cluster Access Issues**: Verify that kubeconfig files are correctly configured and that the script can access the clusters specified in the YAML configuration. üîß
- **Timeouts**: If a component fails to install within the specified timeout, increase the `verify_install_timeout` in the YAML file. ‚è≥

### üìå Conclusion

The EGS Installer Script is a powerful tool for automating the deployment of Kubeslice components across multiple Kubernetes clusters. With proper configuration and usage, it can significantly simplify the installation and management of complex Kubernetes environments. üåü
